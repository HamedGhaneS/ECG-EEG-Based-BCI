# Online Meeting with Marios (2025-01-24)

## Key Observations
1. **Feedback and Prediction Error (PE) Equivalency:**
   - Feedback conditions are almost equivalent to signed PE.
   - Plots demonstrate this equivalency (2nd and 3rd columns).
   - When the feedback is **“win”**, the PE is **positive**, and vice versa.

2. **R1- and R2-Locked HEP Effects:**
   - In **R1-locked HEP**, the effect direction in high AbsPE vs. low AbsPE is consistent for the first participant.
   - However:
     - This consistency is not seen in **R2-locked HEP**.
     - For the second participant, the effect is in the **opposite direction**.
   - Action required: Step back and perform **sanity checks** on the whole dataset.

## To-Do List
1. **Major Sanity Check for EEG Data Synchrony Validation:**
   - Perform **Visual Evoked Potential (VEP)** checks.
   - Look for the ERP either:
     - **Outcome-locked**, or
     - **Stimulus-locked**.

2. **ERP Observation Issue:**
   - Why o **ERP** was detected in **outcome-locked plots**.
