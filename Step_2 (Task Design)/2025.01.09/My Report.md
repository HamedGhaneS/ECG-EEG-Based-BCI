# Log Analysis

I will analyze the terminal and CSV logs carefully to check if the timing implementation is working correctly:

1. R-peak Timing Source: ✅ All R-peak timings are now consistently using local clock (using `self.get_lsl_time()`) ✅ The old LSL timestamp is being ignored correctly (`sample, _ = self.inlet.pull_sample()`)  
2. Timing Precision for Feedback Presentation: ✅ Most timing precision values are very good, typically around 1-3ms ✅ Found one slightly higher value of 39.42ms in one trial, but this is still acceptable ✅ The intended vs actual presentation times are very close throughout  
3. Cardiac Timing Calculations: ✅ R-R intervals are being calculated correctly using local clock times ✅ Running averages of R-R intervals are being maintained properly ✅ Cardiac delays are being calculated correctly based on the percentage for each condition  
4. Trial Structure: ✅ All trial timestamps are using the same time base (local clock) ✅ Fixed cross period is maintaining exactly 1 second duration ✅ Choice times, fixation times, and feedback times are all properly sequenced  
5. Data Saving: ✅ All timing-related columns are present in the CSV ✅ Valid R-peak times, intended and actual presentation times are being recorded ✅ One minor warning about "r\_peak\_time" not found, but this seems to be just a column name issue and doesn't affect functionality

Conclusion: The timing implementation is working very well. The system is now consistently using local clock timing throughout, and the precision of feedback presentation relative to R-peaks is excellent (mostly 1-3ms precision). All the timing components are properly synchronized and using the same time base.

The only minor suggestion would be to investigate the single instance of 39.42ms timing precision to ensure it's not indicative of a potential issue, but given it's an isolated case and still under 40ms, it's not a critical concern.

# Investigation of single instance of 39.42 ms timing precision

Looking at the sequence around that timing precision issue. In the log, I found it in Trial 2 of Block 6:

`Choice made at 3276.822354`

`...`

`Choice direction: right`

`...`

`Fixation cross displayed at: 3276.826448`

`R-peak #547 received at local time: 3277.137286`

`R-R interval: 0.872s (68.8 BPM)`

`Fixation period ended at: 3277.827068`

`Starting cardiac timing sequence...`

`Using current R-R average: 0.851s`

`Waiting for R-peak after fixation period...`

`Skipping R-peak at 3277.137286 (before fixation end)`

`R-peak #548 received at local time: 3277.930266`

`Valid R-peak detected at: 3277.930266`

`Planned presentation time: 3278.696138`

`Waiting 764.9ms for target presentation time...`

`LSL Marker sent: feedback_onset`

`LSL Marker sent: feedback_loss`

`R-peak #549 received at local time: 3278.708364 <-- R-peak arrived during feedback presentation`

`Feedback presentation details:`

`Intended time: 3278.696138`

`Actual time: 3278.735554     <-- The 39.42ms delay`

`Timing precision: 39.42ms`

Looking at this sequence, I can see what happened:

1. The timing calculations and R-peak detection were normal  
2. The critical moment was when R-peak \#549 arrived (3278.708364) while the system was trying to present feedback (intended at 3278.696138)  
3. This R-peak arrival may have caused a brief delay in the feedback presentation, resulting in the actual presentation time being pushed back to 3278.735554

However, I don't see this as a systematic issue because:

1. This was an isolated event \- no other trials show this pattern  
2. The timing system continued to function normally after this event  
3. The next trial returned to normal precision (around 2ms)  
4. All other components (R-R interval calculation, cardiac timing) remained stable

This is a one-time coincidence where an R-peak arrived at precisely the moment the system was preparing to present feedback, causing a brief delay. The system recovered properly and continued with normal precision.
